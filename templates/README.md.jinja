# CBE 30338 Chemical Process Control

This repository comprises a collection of Jupyter/Python notebooks in support of **CBE 30338 Chemical Process Control**,
a course taught at the University of Notre Dame. Please note there is a companion site
[**CBE 32338 Process Control Laboratory**](https://jckantor.github.io/CBE32338/) with additional notebooks demonstrating
the practical implementation of these concepts using the Temperature Control Laboratory.

The links below display the notebooks as regular HTML web pages. From there you can run the notebook on
[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) or download to run on your own laptop. To run on your own
laptop you will need to install Jupyter and Python 3, such as the excellent
[Anaconda distribution from Continuum Analytics](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

Please let me know (jeff at nd.edu) if you any thoughts or suggestions on how these notebooks could be improved for
teaching and learning the principles of Chemical Process Control.
